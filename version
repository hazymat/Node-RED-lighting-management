- Loads of CSS updates, panels with inner shadow / rounded corners etc., nicer panel titles
- Optional zone sensor debug UI, which shows
 - status (triggering status, time remaining on timer, or idle)
 - triggered by (i.e. which sensor caused the trigger)
 - triggered at (e.g. 4 seconds ago, 12 minutes ago, 2 days ago etc.)

02/07/2021
- Support for switches in the scene
- Support for a master dimmer for the zone (can be enabled / disabled)
- Report back scene changes over MQTT
- Bugfixes and code re-factoring
 - The "actuate" and "scene manage" functions now wrapped in two new subflows
 - Many other changes too numerous to mention
- Support for multisensors:
 - A multisensor is a single device containing various presence sensors e.g. PIR, Microwave, Audio presence detection
 - When presence is detection, lights turn on to a "favourite" or default scene. This default is indicated with a red heart on the UI and can be changed easily.
 - A multisensor can be created in dashboard and assigned to a zone
 - Zones can contain more than one multisensor
 - When the multisensor is assigned to the zone, the scene controller UI shows various options to
  - enable / disable each detection type
  - display detections
  - change thresholds for light / sound level
  - change the sensor timer (i.e. delay) - how long light stays on for, after detection finishes. This is facilitated with timestamps and polling, kind of like cron.
  - enable / disable actual LEDs on the multisensor unit itself
